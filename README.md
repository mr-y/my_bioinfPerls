# my_bioinfPerls
my_bioinfPerls is a collection of Perl scripts I have made for my own purposes, but for which I have made an effort to make them useful for others too.
For instructions on how to use a particular script: check comment in the beginning of the script file or try giving the switch -h/--help to the script.
Some scripts are made to work well enough for the data at hand when writing them, so you will need to make sure that they work on your data too.
The scripts are released under the GPL3 licence.
