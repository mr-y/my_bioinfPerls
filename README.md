# my_bioinfPerls
my_bioinfPerls is a collection of Perl scripts I have made for my own purposes, but I have made an effort to make useful for others too.
For instructions on how to use a particular script: check comment in the beginning of the script file or try giving the switch -h/--help to the script.
